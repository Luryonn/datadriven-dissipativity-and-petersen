Using dissipativity theory and petersen's lemma to derive sum-of-squares conditions to data-driven control of nonlinear polynoimial systems, both both codes consist of data acquisition experiment (through MATLAB ODE solver) and control law synthesis (through SOS Programming). The systems in which were applied the developed strategy are a Van der Pol oscillator and a polynomial system found in Nonlinear Systems (Khalil, H. K., 2002) Example 14-9.
